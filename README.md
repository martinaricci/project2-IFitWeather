# project2-IFitWeather

I had a bunch of ideas for the design of this app and I did look at a few completed projects (without checking their code, of course) to see what others were displaying in their app and how it looked.
Keeping things simple was the aim here. Signing up will allow you to access the main page where I decided to show only the temperature and weather description. I also liked the animated weather icon and felt that was a better representation of the current weather in the city of interest than a background image so I wanted to implement that into my app and I considered a few possible scenarios such as clear sky, cloud, snow, sunny, rain e.t.c and wrote a bunch of conditional statements to check if the weather description contained one of keywords and then update the weather icon. 

## Useful Resources:
- OpenWeatherMap API
- SQL and ORM to create a database table structure and interact with my relationally-stored data


## Key takeaway
What I have mostly learned from this project is how to access each part of the returned JSON data from the API response and use it in different ways and how to link each path. Although my methodology needs some refining, itâ€™s bound to get better with more practice.

The application has been built using Ruby Sinatra, HTML & Css.
